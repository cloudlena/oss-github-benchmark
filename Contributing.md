# How to Contribute to the OSS-Benchmark project

Contributing to this very project is very easy. If you want to add or change an institution you need to edit the [github_repos.md](/github_repos.md) file.

| **Institution**                                                                            | **organisations**                 | **Sector**           |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|
| Bedag                                                                                      | bedag                             | IT                   |
| 56K Cloud                                                                                  | 56kcloud                          | IT                   |

Check if you can find the Institution name on the [github_repos.md](/github_repos.md) list. If not, add it to the list on the bottom of the file. If the Institution is already there but one of its GitHub organizations is missing, only add the organization.

**Important:** The organisation name has to be the same as the name in the url. For example: "https://github.com/bedag" -> organisation Name is "bedag".

**Important:**
The sector needs to be one of these:
- FoodBeverage
- Gov_Companies
- Gov_Federal
- IT
- Communities
- Gov_Cities
- Gov_Cantons
- Media
- NGOs
- ResearchAndEducation
- Banking
- Others
- Insurances
- Pharma
- PolitcalParties

Just edit or append the file and make a pull request.

If everything is correct it will be added and updated on the website.
